### Image-Text Translation

This project has been made as a part of TMLC's (The Machine Learning Company's) Deep Learning Program

### Notebooks

text_extraction.ipynb - Translation of text in images to English and replacing original image with translated text
text_translate.ipynb - Translation of text input to English

#### Streamlit GUI for the project can be found in the Img-Text-Translation-Streamlit folder

[NOTE : BECAUSE OF INSTALLING THE TRANSFORMERS, THE MEMORY CONSUMED BY THE CODE IS EXCEEDING THE STREAMLIT MEMORY LIMIT, SO THE DEPLOYED APP WILL CRASH ONCE INPUT IS TAKEN. SO IF YOU WANT TO RUN AND SEE THE MAGIC HAPPEN, RUNNING IT LOCALLY ON YOUR SYSTEM IS PREFERED RATHER THAN THE DEPLOYED APP. INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN LOCALLY IS GIVEN IN THE STREAMLIT FOLDER OF THE REPO]
